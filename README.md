# CS50 FootStats

This application is my final project for the [Harvard CS50 Course on edX](https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x), and it consists of an application for fast data visualization about the world's major football leagues.

You can see a live version running [here](https://cs50-footstats.glitch.me/).

### How To Run

  - Run `npm install` to download the dependencies;
  - Create a `.env` file with the following structure and fill the gaps:
